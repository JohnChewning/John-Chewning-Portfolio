# John-Chewning-Portfolio

##Description

In this project, we created a portfolio page from scratch. the goal was to have an accessible page that showcased my work in school. 

##Installation

Pushed the code into the github repository and deployed in into github pages.

##Usage

The page has a navigation bar that directs to the About Me, Work, and Contact Me sections. My first project will link to the Horiseon Homepage that was refactored in the first project. Eventually all projects will link to various things i will complete throughout the course.

##License

Please refer to the lisence in the repo
